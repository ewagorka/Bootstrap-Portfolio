# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Personal portfolio page, created with Bootstrap elements

## Project Description
For the third week's challenge we were asked to recreate our previous personal portfolio website, using bootstrap elements and customising them ourselves.

The requirements for this project were:
* Having a clear and descriptive commits history on GitHub
* The project follows folder structure provided in instructions
* The portfolio page has the folloing elements:
    * A navigation bar with links navigationg to appropriate sections
    * A hero section
    * A work section made with Bootsrap card elements
    * A skills section
    * An about/ contact section
    * A footer section


## My Approach
I started off by diving into the requirements and noting all the must-have elements that I needed to include in my portfolio. Once I had a clear vision in mind, I turned to Bootstrap and created my basic page structure with them the appropriate components. 

After that I started customising each component to match my style. I kept the same colors and images from my old portfolio, just so I could see the difference that using Bootstrap could make to the look of the site. I really enjoyed playing around with Bootstraps cards. I liked them so much, that I decided to give my skills section a dedicated row, just so I can experiment with the a bit more. 

To make sure I was keeping everything organised, I created a new branch for when I was working on each component. I even tried to create sub-branches from branches, but that turned out to be a little complicated to me so, I stuck with one branch per component instead.

Overall I'm a big fan of the final effect and how my portfolio turned out with the use of Bootsrap elements.
